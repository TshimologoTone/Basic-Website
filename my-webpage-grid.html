    <h3>Location : Cape Town</h3>
    I believe everyone born outside of the Western Cape, travelling to Cape Town is their desire simply because of what we were able to hear about the city. I genuinely want to experience the beach, the weather, the beautiful things that the city has to offer and ultimately experience the climate of the city.

    <h2>Foreign Language</h2>
    <h4>The foreign language that I would love to learn is Spanish, I simply love the culture around spanish people and their diverse dishes; so I believe having the ability to speak their language will help me to connect more with them.</h4>

            <h3>Wynberg</h3>
            One fact about this place is that it is the first place I lived in my own apartment, after getting a job in 2022 it became pivotal to find a place close to work and so where I found an apartment was simply 3 minutes away from my previous place of employment.

            <h3>Brakpan</h3>
            Brakpan is simply home away from home, it is a Place place where I was birthed from and it is a place that I continually visit for rejuvination and for strengthening. I also go there for entertainment at Carnival City.

            <h3>Welgedacht (Springs)</h3>
            During my undergraduate days I fell in love with a damsel and she was from the land of Mpumalanga in Bushbuckridge. So during our love, one day I was inspired to visit her at her home province and that was a whole beautiful experience, no lie the land is preetty hot and a bit dry but things are affordable and one can get a lot done through the day.
